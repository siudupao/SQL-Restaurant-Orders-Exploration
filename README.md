# SQL-Restaurant-Orders-Exploration

Project Overview
----
The dataset for this project can be obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedharris/restaurant-order-details). It consists of data related to an online food delivery service, including information on customers, orders, restaurants, and reviews. 

In this project, I explore the data to uncover insights relating to customer behavior, restaurant performance, and delivery service efficiency.

<b> The project is divided into 4 sections: </b>

Section A - Data Cleaning - Before jumping right into the analysis, I inspected the data to ensure that the data was correct, consistent, and usable.

Section B - Exploring Customer Behaviour

Section C - Exploring Restaurant Performance

Section C - Exploring Delivery Service
